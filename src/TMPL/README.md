# Solidity templates

All `*.sol.tmpl` files in this directory are templates to generate Solidity source code by globally replacing `TMPL` within the file.
The generated code MUST NOT be modified further.
`TMPLSwap.sol` is a special template that is used similarly, but the results constitute only boilerplate and are expected to be modified.

See the root `Taskfile.yml` for usage of the templates.
